# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

This project aims to classify brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes the EfficientNetB0 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tunes it on a custom dataset of brain tumor MRI images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the training and testing datasets.
- `models/`: Contains the saved model weights and architecture.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the required Python libraries for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
